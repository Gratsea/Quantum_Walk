# Quantum_Walk

Algorithm for finding the correct coin operators for generating high dimensional maximally entangled states. The state has two degrees of freedom, one is always 2-dimensional and the other one is of an arbitrary dimension. Quantum walk is implemented in order to create high-dimensional maximally entangled states.
